Description: Assignment 2
Author: alex rodriguez
Date: 4.10.22
Bugs: None that I know of
Reflection: the biggest problem I had was with priorities. I was pulling my hair out
trying to figure out why mine was different from yours. turns out I mistyped "no new job this slice" to
"no new job slice". hours wasted. otherwise really enjoyed it. top 50% of your labs so far. 

felt significantly easier than the last assignment spellchecker.
